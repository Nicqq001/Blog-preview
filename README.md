### What I Learned

What i learned is to how to use the font.ttf file.
It need to install first, and "ctrl + ," find text editor - font family and change ('Figtree', Consolas, monospace) to what kind of Font.ttf you install.

and do this in CSS file

```CSS
@font-face{
    font-family: 'Figtree Local';
    src: url('assets/fonts/Figtree-Medium.ttf.ttf') format('truetype'); /* Local path */
    font-weight: 500;
    font-style: normal;
}
After doing this
body{
    font-family: 'Figtree Local', sans-serif;
}
```
You can also combine it

### Continued development

I going to Learn about the Css and master it, After this I'm going to learn about Javascript
